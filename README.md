# Global SuperStore Dataset Cleaning with Python

This repository contains Python scripts to clean the Global SuperStore dataset. The data cleaning process has been completed, but the analysis is still pending. I welcome any suggestions and updates on the current cleanup process.

## Overview
The Global SuperStore dataset has been cleaned using Python scripts to prepare it for analysis. The cleaned dataset is stored in Excel format and is available for download in the repository.

## Usage
To use the cleaned dataset, simply download the Excel file from the repository and import it into your preferred data analysis tool or environment. If you encounter any issues with the dataset or have suggestions for further improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Note
Please note that there may be permission issues with accessing the dataset via Google Drive. Therefore, the raw dataset has been uploaded in Excel format directly to the repository for easy access.

Thank you for your interest in the project, and I look forward to your contributions and feedback.
